Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it: In simple terms, "git rebase" is a command that allows you to integrate changes from one branch of a software project into another branch. To use this command, you need to have two branches that you want to merge, and you need to be in the branch that you want to integrate the changes into. The basic command is "git rebase branch_to_merge," where "branch_to_merge" is the name of the branch you want to merge changes from.
Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it: "Git cherry-pick" is a command that allows you to select individual commits from a branch and apply them to another branch. This can be useful if you want to choose specific changes from a branch without merging the entire branch. To use this command, you need to know the commit ID of the commit you want to cherry-pick. The basic command is "git cherry-pick <commit-ID>."
